# Flow Framework 2
A framework for application development in Excel VBA.

I will add more information here later. Please ask me if you have any questions.

## Currently Planned Components
* CORE: A basic structure for app development with Excel VBA, including graceful error handling, a clean architectural concept and allowing easy deployment, i.e. automatically removing dev contents.
* CORE-DEV: Structure for development, including automated testing. This structure can easily and safely be removed when creating the production version.
* Various of functionalities based on the prior, non-public FlowFrameworkSelfcontained - different from the development of this prior version, the approach now is to add new functionality only when it actually is needed for the first time for developing an application, leading to a direct exposure to users rightaway

## Terms of Usage
Use freely non-commercially. If you want to use this framework commercially, please get in touch.
